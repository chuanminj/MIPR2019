## Scalable Auto-Encoder (SAE) for Image Compression
This repo provides the supplementary material of MIPR2019 submission, "Layered Image Compression using Scalable Auto-Encoder", where the decoded test images of different lambda values are uploaded. The summarization of bit-rate points are listed in bpp.csv.


### MSE
This folder contains the decoded images using mse-optimized models. The lambda for each sub-folder is shown below.

|Layer|Lambda Value|
|-|-|
|Base|3000|
|Enhance1|1000|
|Enhance2|300|
|Enhance3|100|
|Enhance4|30|

### MS-SSIM

This folder contains the decoded images using msssim-optimized models. The lambda for each sub-folder is shown below.

|Layer|Lambda Value|
|-|-|
|Base|50|
|Enhance1|30|
|Enhance2|10|
|Enhance3|0.5|
